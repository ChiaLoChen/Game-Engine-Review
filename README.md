The two design patterns we will be implementing are Singleton and Observer.
Observer will be used to update the players score for their current game when they pick up collectibles (fruits) or achieve other goals (like reaching the end and getting the key). It will also be used to notify Mario to stop throwing objects and instead push Donkey Kong in his cage off screen when DK Jr. reaches the top and gets the key.

Singleton was used to check the whether an objective is present in the level, in this case being the key (green circle). It will send a debug log saying if one is present or not.

The DLL/Plugin will allow the player to fly by changing their gravity. Clicking a button will turn a bool true or false allowing the player to have on demand flight.

Alex Sneddens challenges with making the design patterns. The main issue I had is that I have not worked on unity in a while as my group has moved to unreal. So I had a lot of trouble trying to remember a lot of the basic commands and relearning the work flow when it comes to unity games and their coding. I also had a little bit of trouble deciding exactly what two design patterns to do for this project so it took a lttile while to noarrow down which two I felt fit the game the best.
