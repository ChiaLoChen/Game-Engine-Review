The two design patterns we will be implementing are Command and Observer.
Observer will be used to update the players score for their current game when they pick up collectibles (fruits) or achieve other goals (like reaching the end and getting the key). It will also be used to notify Mario to stop throwing objects and instead push Donkey Kong in his cage off screen when DK Jr. reaches the top and gets the key.

Command will be used to save the players highscore and will be displayed in future games. If the player gets a better score than their highscore then it will be updated and saved. 

The DLL/Plugin will allow the player to fly by changing their gravity. Using the up and down arrow keys to affect gravity.
